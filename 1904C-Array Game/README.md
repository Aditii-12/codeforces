# Array Game â€“ Codeforces 1904C  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
You are given an array `a` of size `n` and an integer `k`.  
In one operation, you can:  

1. Select two elements `x` and `y` from the array.  
2. Insert their **absolute difference** `|x - y|` into the array.  

You want to minimize the **minimum element** of the array after at most `k` such operations.  

Print the smallest possible minimum value.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Input Format  
- The first line contains a single integer `t` â€” number of test cases.  
- Each test case consists of:  
  - Two integers `n, k` â€” size of the array and number of operations allowed.  
  - An array of `n` integers.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Output Format  
For each test case, output a single integer â€” the minimum possible element after at most `k` operations.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Constraints  
- `1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000`  
- `2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 2000`  
- `1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 3`  
- `1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ 10^9`  
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2000`.
